# Q4 Roadmap
- **P2P Limits v2** GA (with staged rollout)
- **Payouts v2** GA (SDKs: Python/JS; callback signature docs)
- AML screening provider migration (cutover behind feature flag)
- Ledger backfill performance improvements (parallelism, chunking)
- Internal quality: flaky test burn-down, on-call load reduction
